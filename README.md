### Example: count of 3 tables
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, 'Carousel' AS table_name FROM carousel
union all
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, 'Luggage' AS table_name FROM luggage
union all
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, 'Employees' AS table_name FROM employee
```

Running the query results in:
```
 count  | table_name
--------+------------
   3000 | Carousel
 170000 | Luggage
   7495 | Employees
(3 rows)
```

#### (3)
For the pilot error, there were some pilots whose accrued flight hours was larger than the average flight hours for a given pilot during the same period. Hence, this would be a clerical error (maybe even purposeful - since more hours = hire salary).

#### (4)
```sql
ALTER TABLE employee ADD CONSTRAINT age_constraint CHECK
(
	(current_date - dob) >= 18 * 365
);
```
- This will check if the age of an employee is greater than 18

```sql
ALTER TABLE pilot ADD CONSTRAINT fhours_empdays_ratio CHECK
(
	flight_hours <= (current_date - hire_date) * 2.302
);
```
- Flight_hours must be <= (employment days) * daily avg 
- Daily average is calculated by 840 (avg hrs/month) divided by 365

```sql
ALTER TABLE carousel ADD CONSTRAINT terminal_constraint CHECK
(
    terminal between 1 and 10
);
```
- Max terminal # between 1 and 10

```sql
ALTER TABLE carousel_aircraft ADD CONSTRAINT rn_constraint CHECK
(
    aircraft_rn ~ '^N-\d{3}[A-Z]{2}'
);
```
- Using regex, we can constrain aircraft_rn to be between N-000AA and N-999ZZ as stated here:
